This article explains the mechanics of Derpibooru's autocompletion. _No programming knowledge_ is required to follow along!

I messaged the admins about this problem and they pointed out that Derpibooru already had search autocompletion, although not enabled by default. There was an attempt to enable it by default in 2024, but it [failed](https://github.com/philomena-dev/philomena/commit/f44491685ebec254f3051310bbede662c4b5ba2e).
