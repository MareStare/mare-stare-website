I've been using Derpibooru for years and I've always been annoyed by the lack of tag autocompletion in the search bar. Earlier this year, my frustration reached its peak, and I decided to take matters into my own hooves. I messaged the admins about this problem and they pointed out that Derpibooru already had search autocompletion, although not enabled by default. There was an attempt to enable it by default in 2024, but it [failed](https://github.com/philomena-dev/philomena/commit/f44491685ebec254f3051310bbede662c4b5ba2e).
